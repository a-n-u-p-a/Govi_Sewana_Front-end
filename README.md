[//]: # ("SOIL": {)

[//]: # (//        "1": "Ideal soil type: Potatoes thrive in loose, well-drained, fertile soil with slightly acidic pH &#40;5.5-6.5&#41;. Heavy clay soils retain too much water and hinder tuber development, so they are unsuitable for potato cultivation. To improve drainage in clay soils, consider incorporating organic matter like compost or aged manure, or raised bed planting.",)

[//]: # (//        "2": "Tilling: Deeply till the soil &#40;around 30 cm depth&#41; to break up compaction and improve drainage. This allows for better root growth, water infiltration, and oxygen exchange in the soil, all crucial for healthy potato plant development.",)

[//]: # (//        "3": "Amendments: Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility and structure. Compost adds organic matter that improves water retention, aeration, and nutrient availability for the plants. A soil test can help determine if lime is needed to adjust soil pH to the slightly acidic range preferred by potatoes.")
